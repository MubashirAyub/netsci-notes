This online book is largely inspired by Professor [Yong-Yeol ("YY") Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/)'s online class of [INFO I606 *Network Science*](http://yongyeol.com/teaching/2020SP_netsci_syllabus.pdf) at Indiana University Bloomington, and the [*Network Science*](http://networksciencebook.com/) book by [Albert-L치szl칩 Barab치si](https://barabasi.com/). I am deeply grateful to Professor YY Ahn for allowing me to attend the online course and to Professor Barab치si for generously making his book available to everyone online. Wihtout their help, this project is impossible.
