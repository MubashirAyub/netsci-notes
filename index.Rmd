# Welcome{-}

This online book is largely inspired by Professor [Yong-Yeol ("YY") Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/)'s online class of [INFO I606 *Network Science*](http://yongyeol.com/teaching/2020SP_netsci_syllabus.pdf) at Indiana University Bloomington, and the [*Network Science*](http://networksciencebook.com/) book by [Albert-L치szl칩 Barab치si](https://barabasi.com/). I am deeply grateful for Professor YY Ahn for allowing me to attend the online course and for Professor Barab치si for generously making his book available to everyone online. Wihtout their help, this project is impossible. 

If you notice any errors, including typos and mistakes in math formulas, you are welcome to contribute to the project by clicking the "Editing" button on the upper-left of this online book (shown below). You will be directed to fork this project on GitHub before you and suggest changes.

This book has several custom blocks:

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
This is a note, a general notice. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdreminder'}
This is a reminder, usually just to remind myself something I don't understand yet. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdtip'}
This is a tip, which helps you to understand a concept or memorize a formula. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
This is a caution, to inform you, for example, an error in publications. 
```
